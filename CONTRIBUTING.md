### Contributing to the Ontology Registry and Repository Documentation

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the documentation of the 
[MMI ORR software](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr).
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to 
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### How to contribute?

We follow a [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and 
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) workflow.

Feel free to fork the repository, add your changes and give back by issuing a pull request. 
You can edit the docs directly on your fork at GitHub 
(not having to ever download the files if you prefer). 

You are also very welcome to make any suggestions or report any kind of problem with the documentation 
by using the [tracker](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr-docs/issues).

Be aware you may be working on a repository that has already been forked from the original (mmisw) repository. If your change is explicit to that local repository, you may want to leave the changes in the fork -- ideally located in a document unique to your repository. But if your changes are general to all the repositories, please generate a pull request so that the documentation for everyone can be updated.

#### Who uses these documents? Referencing the ORR

Keep in mind that these documents are referenced by all the ORR distributions, not just the main one at http://mmisw.org. While the examples may need to use the original path, try to refer to the software in a location- and source-independent way (e.g., not "the mmisw.org application" or "MMI's ORR application", but "this ORR application".
