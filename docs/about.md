## Software

Developed by MMI[^mmi], the Ontology Registry and Repository (ORR) is a web application and service to create, update, 
access, and map ontologies and their terms. 
Funding for the version 3 modifications to the ORR software were provided by the EarthCube X-DOMES Project[^xdomes].

The latest version of the ORR software (v3),
has been deployed to multiple sites, including
the MMI Ontology Registry and Repository at [https://mmisw.org](https://mmisw.org)
(for marine science artifacts) and 
the ESIP Community Ontology Repository at [http://cor.esipfed.org](http://cor.esipfed.org) 
(for earth science artifacts), 
where it continues to operate as the ESIP Federation's Community Ontology Repository. 
Those pages link to additional documentation available for each system.

## People

John Graybeal (now at Stanford University) provides program management and community coordination,
and Carlos Rueda (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) provides technical leadership for
the ORR software development, including technical support as needed.  
John Graybeal also provides funding for continued support of MMI ORR operations:
the Domain Name registration (via TierraNet.com) and the site hosting (via DigitalOcean.com).

Together, these two individuals provide strategic oversight for ORR activities and directions, 
acting as an Executive Committee for the MMI and ORR projects. 
The MMI ORR project has a channel on the ESIP Federation Slack workspace, 
as MMI ORR provides a working example and test environment for the ESIP Community Ontology Repository (COR).

We thank the ESIP Federation for their continued support for the deployed COR system.

We thank Felimon Gayanilo (Texas A&M Corpus Christi) for his past operational support team for the system,
and Janet Fredericks (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) for her support for ORR development 
through management of the X-DOMES[^xdomes] program, funded by NSF's EarthCube project. 

## History

The Marine Metadata Interoperability project[^mmi], originally funded by National Science Foundation grants, 
initiated development of the Ontology Registry and Repository.
The [MMI Semantic Web Services and Tools page](https://marinemetadata.org/mmiswinfo/) contains background information about the ORR, 
including links to related information. 
The [MMI Semantic Framework page](https://marinemetadata.org/semanticframework) has more information about the semantic framework, 
of which ORR forms a part.
