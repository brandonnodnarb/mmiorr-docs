### Contributing to the MMI ORR Documentation

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the documentation of the [MMI ORR software](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr).
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### How to contribute?

We follow a [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) workflow.

Feel free to fork the repository, add your changes and give back by issuing a pull request. You can even edit the docs directly on GitHub, without having to ever download the files. 

You are also very welcome to make any suggestions or report any kind of problem with the documentation by using the [tracker](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr-docs/issues).
