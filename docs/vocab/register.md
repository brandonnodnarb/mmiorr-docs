When you have filled out the vocabulary with at least one term and one property, 
it is ready to be registered, which will convert it into ontology form. 
When you are done with the contents and metadata for your vocabulary, 
click on the Register button to create the ontology. 

You may get an error message indicating that the ontology cannot be registered according to the provided information, 
or without providing some key information. Resolve the issue in order to complete the registration.

When you complete this step, ORR should tell you the ontology of your vocabulary is successfully registered.
