Once you are viewing an ontology that is displayed as a table of terms, click "Create new version" to 
proceed with editing a new version.

You have the option to upload an existing ontology to serve as the new version, but we focus here on the 
in-place editing of the vocabulary. So, select "OK" for the dialog asking whether you want in-place editing or not. 
Then, proceed with editing the cells that need changes, adding new terms (rows) or removing terms. 
Expand the metadata area if you want to adjust information there. Finally, click the "Review and Register" 
button to complete the registration of the new version.
