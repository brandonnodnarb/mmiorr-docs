The MMI Ontology Registry and Repository (ORR) is a web application through which you can create, update, 
access, and map ontologies and their terms. 

Background information about the ORR, including links to related information, is provided at the 
[MMI Semantic Web Services and Tools page](http://marinemetadata.org/mmiswinfo/). 
More information about the semantic framework, of which ORR forms a part, can be found at the 
[MMI Semantic Framework page](http://marinemetadata.org/semanticframework).

The MMI ORR software has been deployed to multiple sites, including http://mmisw.org/ (for marine science artifacts) and http://cor.esipfed.org (for earth science artifacts). Those front pages link to any additional documentation available for each system.
