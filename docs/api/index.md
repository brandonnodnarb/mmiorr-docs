# ORR Ont API Documentation
  
The API documentation is described in detail by each ORR instance according to 
the current version of the ORR Ont being used.
Note that, besides containing the documentation itself, the "ontapi" pages 
below also allow to directly exercise the API against the corresponding 
ORR Ont endpoint.

The following ORR Ont instances provide or will be providing such documentation:

|ORR Instance| API documentation | Main page |
|-|-|-|
| ESIP COR      | [http://cor.esipfed.org/ontapi/](http://cor.esipfed.org/ontapi/) | [http://cor.esipfed.org](http://cor.esipfed.org) | 
| X-DOMES ORR   | [https://xdomes.org/ontapi/](https://xdomes.org/ontapi/) | [https://xdomes.org](https://xdomes.org) | 
| MMI ORR       | https://mmisw.org/ontapi/ | [https://mmisw.org](https://mmisw.org) | 
| SensorML ORR  | http://sensorml.com/ontapi/ | [http://sensorml.com](http://sensorml.com) | 

In each case you can use the "Authorize" button at the top of the "ontapi" page to login with your 
corresponding credentials and in this way be able to perform not only basic `GET` operations, 
but also see expanded responses according to your access privileges and ontology 
visibility settings, as well as perform other operations.
