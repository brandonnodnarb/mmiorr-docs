Welcome and thanks for using the MMI Ontology Registry and Repository (MMI ORR) system.

This is the User's Manual for the MMI ORR and associated MMI tools and services.

This manual is comprised of two main parts:
The first part includes introductory materials, suggestions on getting started, frequently asked questions,
and a list of known issues with the ORR.  The second part describes specific actions that a user might want
to do with the ORR (e.g., working with vocabularies, working with mappings, registering an existing ontology).
