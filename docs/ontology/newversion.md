To register a new version of an ontology, you follow a process very similar to uploading a new ontology. 
The easiest scenario, and the one documented here, is to upload an ontology that started as an ORR ontology, 
and has just been modified. But you can use any ontology, recognizing that if it doesn't have metadata in it recognizable to the ORR,
you will have to re-enter all the metadata that was originally entered.

The original steps are outlined here (you may wish to refer to the 
[Registering an existing ontology page](/ontology/new) for images):

* Click the "Upload ontology" button on the main page to begin the submission process.
* A wizard dialog appears. In the wizard, select the local file and load it to the workspace. 
* Either select or enter the IRI used as the ontology identifier. 
 * If the system detects an ontology IRI candidate within the ontology, the IRI will be shown as a selection item. 
 * Click on the select button to choose any IRI that you want to use as the ontology IRI.
* Once the `Next` button is selected, any metadata detected in the imported ontology is shown in the next dialog.
* Next you will be asked to choose the type of registration (fully-hosted or re-hosted).  
* Finally, you may review and complete the metadata details necessary for registering your ontology. 

When you complete this step, ORR will return you to ontology view page, where you can see the ontology versions including the latest.
