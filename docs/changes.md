!!! note "Are you a user of the MMI ORR instance at mmisw.org?" 
    The MMI ORR instance was recently migrated from the previous version 2.<br> 
    A summary of the major changes in v3 is available [here](/from2to3).

**Noteworthy**

**3.6.7** - 2017-10-12

- "File-type extension" resolution for ontology and term request 
  ([orr-ont#55](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont/issues/55))

**3.6.6** - 2017-10-04

- Use "text/turtle" as response format for term requests with format=ttl
  (previously, "application/sparql-results+ttl")

**3.6.5** - 2017-09-20

- Enable "ttl" (Turtle) as a stored format in backend ([orr-ont#54](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont/issues/54)).

- Fix in the orr-ont backend service regarding self-resolution of ontology format
  ([orr-ont#52](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont/issues/52)).
  With this fix, links in the ORR portal for [LODE dispatch](
  https://github.com/mmisw/orr-portal/issues/106#issuecomment-317095365) 
  should now be correctly handled, as well as by any external service or tool 
  that follows common content negotiation practices.

- Front-end application should now load faster in the browser ([orr-portal#111](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-portal/issues/111)).
  (In general, [optimization had deliberately not been a main concern](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization).) 

**3.6.2** - 2017-06-03

 ([orr-ont#50](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont/issues/50))

- General support for IRIs (both backend and frontend), with many adjustments in relevant 
  parameters, UI widgets and messages, and documentation.
