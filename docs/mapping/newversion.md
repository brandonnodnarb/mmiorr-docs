A new version of an ORR-generated mapping ontology can be created by editing the contents of the 
ontology using the mapping editor interface as in the initial submission.

## Steps for Creating a New Version of a Mapping Ontology

1\. Sign in to ORR

2\. Locate and click the existing mapping ontology.

3\. Click on "Edit new version".

4\. Follow the usual steps to edit the metadata and the mappings. 
You will be able to indicate additional working ontologies, and remove mappings.
