SPARQL is the query language for the Resource Description Framework (recursively, SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). 
It is analogous to SQL for relational databases, allowing queries to be placed for semantic resources. 
The [Wikipedia entry for SPARQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) contains good background information, 
and the [W3C documentation](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) is a good technical read.

SPARQL queries can be done programmatically, with a RESTful interface, against the ORR SPARQL endpoint at 
`http://mmisw.org/sparql` using HTTP GET requests.
A user interface is available at [http://mmisw.org/orr/sparql/](http://mmisw.org/orr/sparql/).

A number of interesting domain-specific examples can be found at 
[http://marinemetadata.org/community/teams/vocdev/orrioos](http://marinemetadata.org/community/teams/vocdev/orrioos).

The [Querying Linked Data with SPARQL](http://www.slideshare.net/olafhartig/querying-linked-data-with-sparql) 
video provides some interesting information about querying with SPARQL.
