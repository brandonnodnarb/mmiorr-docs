A new version of an ORR-generated mapping ontology can be created by editing the contents of the 
ontology using the mapping editor interface as in the initial submission.

## Steps for Creating a New Version of a Mapping Ontology

1\. Sign in to the ORR.

2\. Locate and click the existing mapping ontology.

3\. Click on "Edit new version".
This option will be available only if you have permission to edit the ontology.

4\. Follow the usual steps to edit the metadata and the mappings. 
You will be able to indicate additional working ontologies, and remove mappings.

5\. When done, click "Register" at the top of the page to complete the registration of the new version.
