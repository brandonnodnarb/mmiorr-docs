## Software

Developed by MMI[^mmi], the Ontology Registry and Repository (ORR) is a web application and service to create, update, 
access, and map ontologies and their terms. 
Funding for the latest modifications to the ORR software has been provided by the EarthCube X-DOMES Project[^xdomes].

The latest version of the ORR software (v3),
has been deployed to multiple sites, including
the MMI Ontology Registry and Repository at [https://mmisw.org](https://mmisw.org)
(for marine science artifacts) and 
the ESIP Community Ontology Repository at [http://cor.esipfed.org](http://cor.esipfed.org) 
(for earth science artifacts), 
where it continues to operate under test as ESIP Federation's Community Ontology Repository. 
Those pages link to additional documentation available for each system.

## People

John Graybeal (now at Stanford University) provides program management and community coordination;
Carlos Rueda (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) provides technical leadership for
the ORR software development;
Felimon Gayanilo (Texas A&M Corpus Christi) leads the operational support team for the system;
Janet Fredericks (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) provides current support for ORR development 
through her management of the X-DOMES[^xdomes] program, 
funded by NSF's EarthCube project. 

Together, these four individuals provide strategic oversight for ORR activities and directions, 
acting as an Executive Committee for the MMI and ORR projects.

## History

The Marine Metadata Interoperability project[^mmi], originally funded by National Science Foundation grants, 
initiated development of the Ontology Registry and Repository.
The [MMI Semantic Web Services and Tools page](https://marinemetadata.org/mmiswinfo/) contains background information about the ORR, 
including links to related information. 
The [MMI Semantic Framework page](https://marinemetadata.org/semanticframework) has more information about the semantic framework, 
of which ORR forms a part.
