## ORR Documentation source

The master branch of this repository contains the source of the ORR documentation. 

The documentation source is written in plain text files using 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

We use [MkDocs tool](http://www.mkdocs.org/) for the site generation.

**NOTE**: We are migrating contents from the 
[original site](https://marinemetadata.org/mmiorrusrman)
as well as doing reviewing and updates per recent developments in 
new version ORR v3.

Your help improving this documentation is 
[welcome!](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)


### Generation

The documentation, which is reflected at https://mmisw.org/orrdoc/, 
is automatically generated upon changes pushed to this repo.

In particular, the API documentation at https://mmisw.org/orrdoc/api/ is currently 
generated as explained 
[here](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr-docs/blob/master/docs/swagger-readme.md).
