## Software

The Ontology Registry and Repository (ORR) is a web application through which you can create, update, 
access, and map ontologies and their terms. 
The latest version of the software is Version 3.1, 
which continues to operate under test as ESIP Federation's Community Ontology Repository.

The ORR software has been deployed to multiple sites, including
the MMI Ontology Registry and Repository at [http://mmisw.org](http://mmisw.org) (for marine science artifacts) and 
the ESIP Community Ontology Repository at [http://cor.esipfed.org](http://cor.esipfed.org) (for earth science artifacts). 
Those pages link to additional documentation available for each system.

## People

John Graybeal (now at Stanford University) provides program management for the ORR software, and 
Dr. Carlos Rueda (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) provides technical leadership and development. 
Dr. Felimon Gayanilo (Texas A&M Corpus Christi) leads the operational support team providing system support.
Janet Lundgren (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) provides current support for ORR development 
through her management of the X-DOMES program, funded by NSF's EarthCube project. 

Together, these four individuals provide strategic oversight for ORR activities and directions, 
acting as an Executive Committee for the MMI and ORR projects.

## History

The Marine Metadata Interoperability project, originally funded by National Science Foundation grants, 
initiated development of the Ontology Registry and Repository.
The [MMI Semantic Web Services and Tools page](http://marinemetadata.org/mmiswinfo/) contains background information about the ORR, 
including links to related information. 
The [MMI Semantic Framework page](http://marinemetadata.org/semanticframework) has more information about the semantic framework, 
of which ORR forms a part.
