# ORR API Documentation
  
The API documentation is described in detail for each ORR instance according to 
the version of the ORR Ont software being used.
Besides containing the documentation itself, the API Documentation pages referenced below 
also allow users to directly exercise the API against the corresponding ORR REST endpoint.

The following ORR instances provide or will be providing such documentation:

|ORR Instance| API Documentation | Main Page |
|-|-|-|
| ESIP COR      | [http://cor.esipfed.org/ontapi/](http://cor.esipfed.org/ontapi/) | [http://cor.esipfed.org](http://cor.esipfed.org) | 
| XDOMES ORR    | [https://xdomes.org/ontapi/](https://xdomes.org/ontapi/) | [https://xdomes.org](https://xdomes.org) | 
| MMI ORR       | https://mmisw.org/ontapi/ | [https://mmisw.org](https://mmisw.org) | 
| SensorML ORR  | http://sensorml.com/ontapi/ | [http://sensorml.com](http://sensorml.com) | 

In each case you can use the "Authorize" button at the top of the API Documentation page to login with your 
corresponding credentials. In this way you will be able to perform not only basic `GET` operations, 
but also see expanded responses according to your access privileges and ontology 
visibility settings, as well as perform other operations with the system.

In each API operation description, you are able to set the variables in the descriptions of the API interface, 
so that you can execute the API call, as well as see it appropriately formatted for an invocation with 
the [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) command line tool.
